Many people have different pets and the majority of them are cats. 

Some people think, that cats comfort us, give us the feeling of tranquility because these delicate creatures are soÂ cute!

Nowadays we keep cats as pets, we need them. We do it, because cats are good for us. 

They give us companionship and pleasure. For example, a lonely man keeps a cat, because it is a companionship for him. 

You feel happier when you stroke a cat. Cats teach us to be loving and responsible.
